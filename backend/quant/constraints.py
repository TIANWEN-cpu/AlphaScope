"""Realistic A-share trading constraints for the backtesting engine.

This module models the frictions that the raw :class:`Portfolio` does not:

* **Commission** (broker fee, charged on both buy and sell legs)
* **Stamp duty** (印花税, charged on the *sell* leg only, A-share rule)
* **Slippage** (成交价偏离, executed price deviates from the signal price)
* **T+1 settlement** (买入当日不得卖出, A-share rule)
* **Price-limit filter** (涨跌停板无法成交)

Everything here is pure and deterministic so it can be unit-tested without any
LLM / network / market data dependency. The intent is to make backtest results
honest: without these frictions a backtest systematically overstates returns.
