"""Demo Provider — serves the packaged seed price database with zero API keys.

Purpose
-------
On first launch, before the user has configured any data-source key, the app
would otherwise show empty price charts and a broken workbench. This provider
reads the **bundled seed database** (``seed/ai_finance.db`` → shipped at
``data/db/ai_finance.db``) so that the ~10 blue-chip symbols have real
historical bars out of the box.

Design rules (from the honest-backtest / 不用静态样本伪装后端结果 principle):
- This provider is **always last-priority** (priority = 5) so a configured real
  source (akshare/tushare/eastmoney) always wins. It only answers when nothing
  else is available.
- ``requires_key = False`` and ``is_available()`` checks the seed DB file exists.
- ``get_prices`` returns seed bars tagged ``source="demo_seed"`` and marks
  ``demo_sample=True`` so the frontend can clearly label "演示样本" — it never
  masquerades as live data.
- News / fundamentals / other types raise ``NotImplementedError``: the demo
  provider is a price-only safety net, not a full fake backend.
